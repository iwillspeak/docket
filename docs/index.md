# Docket

> Just document it

Simple markdown to HTML documentation rendering. Docket aims to be a Rust clone of [`d`](https://github.com/sjl/d).

Docket is open source on [GitHub](http://github.com/iwillspeak/docket). This site was rendered by `docket` from [the `docs/` folder](https://github.com/iwillspeak/docket/tree/main/docs).
